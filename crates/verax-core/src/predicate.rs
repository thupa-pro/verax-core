//! Predicate types for the Axiom Protocol.

//! A predicate defines the semantic relationship between a statement's

//! statement's CBOR payload.

//! # Predicate Codes
//!
//! | Code | Variant          | Description                                                    |
//! |------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | 0    | `Attests`        | General claim of truth regarding the subject                   |
//! | 1    | `Authors`        | Issuer created the subject Artifact                            |
//! | 2    | `DerivedFrom`    | Subject Artifact was transformed from the Object Artifact      |
//! | 3    | `Supersedes`     | This Statement replaces the Object Statement                   |
//! | 4    | `Revokes`        | This Statement invalidates the Object Statement or Artifact    |
//! | 5    | `Endorses`       | Countersignature or multi-party approval                       |
//! | 6    | `Appends`        | Streaming chunk linkage (Subject is Chunk N, Object is Chunk N-1) |
//! | 7    | `CompliesWith`   | Subject Artifact satisfies the policy defined in Object Artifact |
//! | 8    | `Recovers`       | Guardian authorises replacement of a lost key                  |
//!
//! The constant [`CORE_PREDICATES`] provides a slice of all nine predicates
//! for iteration.
